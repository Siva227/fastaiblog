# Looking back on the season past

Chelsea FC Women romped to the title last season. They were scoring goals for fun(a whopping 3 goals per 90) while not conceding very many(0.45 goals againt per 90). But for the uncharacteristic blip against, they may well have finished the season unbeaten. What stands out is just how much a juggernaut Chelsea were last season. The defensive improvement from the previous season was impressive while the offense kept purring along at a wonderful pace.
